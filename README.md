# About-me

Hello my name is **Benjamin Karioki**. I am **18 years old** and currently studying in UCD, doing the foundation course. My dad is a captain in an airline called Kenya Airways and my mum is a counsellor who majored in business and psychology. I have a younger sister who is 17. She is studying A-levels in South Africa for the next 2 years.

I have a few hobbies and interests:
> Football
> Swimming
> Video games

I also play music, particularly the **piano** . I have played it for the past 8 years. I'm also learning how to play the guitar, hopefully I'm able to play really well soon.
I hope to study computer science in UCD next year, after I progress from the foundation course. I don't know which path the degree will take me to, but I hope to know when the time comes.
